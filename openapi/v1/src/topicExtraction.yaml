      This feature is in open beta through Rev AI Labs.
      This API provides information about topics discussed in conversation. To see our topic extraction API in practice you'll need
      either a [transcript](https://www.rev.ai/docs#tag/Transcript) generated from our [speech-to-text API](https://www.rev.ai/docs) or a
      conversation in plain text.
      ## Key Features
      - Topic List: Our API will identify the topics discussed and assign them contextual scores. This yields insights into not only
        which topics are discussed, but how prominent they are in the conversation.
      - Informant List: Each topic identified will include a list of phrases that inform the topic's discussion. When a Rev AI transcript
        is the submission format, these informants will include timing information that allow the user to track where in the conversation
        these topics are discussed.

        Starts an asynchronous job to extract topics from a transcript.
        The transcript can be supplied through `text` as plain text or `json` as a [rev.com transcript format](https://www.rev.ai/docs#tag/Transcript)
